## Documentation Standards

### User Journey Documentation
- **Entry Points**: How users discover and enter each journey
- **Key Actions**: Main user actions and decision points
- **Touchpoints**: System interactions and state changes
- **Exit Points**: Journey completion and next steps
- **Pain Points**: Current friction and improvement opportunities

### Workflow Diagrams
- Use Mermaid diagrams for consistency
- Include swimlanes for multi-actor processes
- Show data flow and system interactions
- Highlight optimization opportunities

### Business Logic Flows
- Document decision trees and business rules
- Include validation and error handling
- Show integration points with external systems
- Identify scalability considerations

## Key User Types

### 1. New Users
- First-time visitors and registrants
- Focus: Discovery, onboarding, initial engagement
- Primary goals: Understand platform value, create content, connect with others

### 2. Content Creators
- Regular content uploaders and managers
- Focus: Content creation, optimization, audience building
- Primary goals: Share content, grow following, monetize (future)

### 3. Social Users
- Community participants and consumers
- Focus: Discovery, interaction, relationship building
- Primary goals: Find content, engage with creators, build network

### 4. Admins/Moderators
