- High database load from repeated queries
- Poor scalability as content volume grows

#### 2. Content Scoring Algorithm
**Current Issues:**
- **Synchronous Processing**: Scoring happens during request time

- **Limited Personalization**: Basic preference-based scoring
- **No Real-time Adaptation**: Static scoring without behavior learning

**Performance Impact:**
- High computational overhead per request
- Inconsistent response times
- Limited personalization effectiveness

#### 3. Feed Assembly and Caching
**Current Issues:**
- **No Feed Precomputation**: Real-time assembly for each request
- **Limited Caching Strategy**: Basic TTL-based caching

- Poor scalability during peak usage

## Specific Bottleneck Analysis

### Database Query Bottlenecks

#### Inefficient Content Retrieval
**Current Query Pattern:**
```javascript
// Example of current inefficient query
const feed = await getDocs(query(
  collection(db, 'content'),
  where('isPublic', '==', true),
  where('category', '==', userPreferences.category),
  orderBy('createdAt', 'desc'),
  limit(20)
));
```

**Issues Identified:**
1. **No Composite Indexing**: Queries on multiple fields without proper indexing
2. **Large Result Sets**: Fetching more data than needed for initial display
3. **No Query Result Pagination**: Inefficient offset-based pagination
4. **Repeated Queries**: Identical queries for similar user preferences

#### Social Graph Queries
**Current Issues:**
- **Follower Graph Traversal**: Expensive recursive queries for social feeds
- **No Graph Caching**: Rebuilding social graphs for each request
- **Inefficient Friendship Queries**: Multiple queries for friend relationships
- **No Social Proximity Calculation**: Limited social relevance scoring

### Algorithm Performance Bottlenecks

#### Content Scoring Complexity
**Current State:**
- **Multiple Scoring Factors**: Engagement, recency, relevance, social proximity
- **Synchronous Calculation**: All scoring happens during request
- **No Incremental Updates**: Full recalculation for each content item
- **Limited ML Integration**: Basic rule-based scoring

**Performance Issues:**
- **High CPU Usage**: Complex calculations for each feed request
- **Inconsistent Latency**: Variable response times based on content volume
- **Scalability Limits**: Performance degrades linearly with content growth

#### Recommendation Engine Bottlenecks
**Current Issues:**
- **Cold Start Problem**: No recommendations for new users

### Caching and Delivery Bottlenecks

#### Cache Strategy Issues
**Current State:**
- **Basic TTL Caching**: Simple time-based expiration
- **No Smart Invalidation**: Over-invalidation on content updates
- **Limited Cache Granularity**: Same cache for all users
- **No Predictive Caching**: Reactive caching only

**Performance Impact:**
- **Low Cache Hit Rates**: Frequent cache misses causing slow responses
- **Stale Content**: Over-caching leading to outdated feeds
- **Poor Personalization**: Generic caching misses user-specific optimizations

## Feed Generation Performance Issues

### Infinite Scroll Implementation
**Current Issues:**
- **No Virtual Scrolling**: Loading all content into DOM
- **Large Payloads**: Sending unnecessary data to clients
- **No Progressive Loading**: All-or-nothing content delivery

### Real-time Update Bottlenecks
**Current Issues:**
- **Polling-based Updates**: Inefficient real-time data fetching
- **No Delta Updates**: Sending complete feed on each update
- **WebSocket Overhead**: Excessive connection management
- **No Update Batching**: Individual updates for each content change

  collection(db, 'content'),
  where('isPublic', '==', true),
  where('category', 'in', userPreferences.categories),
  orderBy('score', 'desc'), // Pre-computed relevance score
